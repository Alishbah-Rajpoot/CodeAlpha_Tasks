# CodeAlpha_Tasks

This repository contains all the projects completed during my CodeAlpha Internship. Each task demonstrates practical applications of data science and machine learning concepts through structured implementations and analyses.

Tasks

TASK 1: Iris Flower Classification
● Use measurements of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) as input data.
● Train a machine learning model to classify the species based on these measurements.
● Use libraries like Scikit-learn for easy dataset access and model building.
● Evaluate the model’s accuracy and performance using test data.
● Understand basic classification concepts in machine learning.

TASK 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
● Analyze unemployment rate data representing unemployed people percentage.
● Use Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization of unemployment trends.
● Investigate the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment rates.
● Identify key patterns or seasonal trends in the data.
● Present insights that could inform economic or social policies.

TASK 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
● Collect car-related features like brand goodwill, horsepower, mileage, etc.
● Train a regression model to predict car prices based on these features.
● Handle data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
● Use Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for the workflow.
● Understand real-world applications of machine learning in price prediction.

TASK 4: Sales Prediction using Python
● Predict future sales based on factors like advertising spend, target segment, and platform.
● Prepare data through cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.
● Use regression or time series models to forecast sales.
● Analyze how changes in advertising impact sales outcomes.
● Deliver actionable insights for business marketing strategies.

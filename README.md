# CodeAlpha_Tasks

This repository contains all the projects completed during my CodeAlpha Internship. Each task demonstrates practical applications of data science and machine learning concepts through structured implementations and analyses.

🗂️ Tasks

✅ TASK 1: Iris Flower Classification
● Use measurements of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) as input data.
● Train a machine learning model to classify the species based on these measurements.
● Use libraries like Scikit-learn for easy dataset access and model building.
● Evaluate the model’s accuracy and performance using test data.
● Understand basic classification concepts in machine learning.

✅ TASK 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
● Analyze unemployment rate data representing unemployed people percentage.
● Use Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization of unemployment trends.
● Investigate the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment rates.
● Identify key patterns or seasonal trends in the data.
● Present insights that could inform economic or social policies.

✅ TASK 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
● Collect car-related features like brand goodwill, horsepower, mileage, etc.
● Train a regression model to predict car prices based on these features.
● Handle data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
● Use Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for the workflow.
● Understand real-world applications of machine learning in price prediction.

✅ TASK 4: Sales Prediction using Python
● Predict future sales based on factors like advertising spend, target segment, and platform.
● Prepare data through cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.
● Use regression or time series models to forecast sales.
● Analyze how changes in advertising impact sales outcomes.
● Deliver actionable insights for business marketing strategies.
